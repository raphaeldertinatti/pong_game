# Simple Classic Pong Game
 Simple version of the classic game "Pong" using javascript p5.js.
 
 - You can find the [game here](https://editor.p5js.org/raphaeldertinatti/full/NobD48MDF)
 
 Click on screen, use 'up arrow' and 'down arrow' keys to move up and down.
 
## Goals
My goal was to practice javascript developing a simple game, it was very interesting to applying features like the scoreboard, the collision between ball and rackets, and the opponent's behavior (that will always let the player win :p).

I Hope you enjoy!
